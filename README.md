# It's Pong!
The old school Atari Pong game remade in terminal with Golang.  

# General Info & State of the Project
To interact with terminal, the [tcell](https://github.com/gdamore/tcell) package API is used.  

This project is in very early stages, very few things are implemented at the moment.

## Further Plans & Todos
- Make it interactive
- Make it interactive for both players
- Implement collision system
- Implement scoring system

If it works out, eventually I may expand the project:
1. that it can be hosted via HTTP API
2. that it is compatible with online play

# Keep in Mind
This project is primarily an exercise for me to learn more about the Go language. That being said, **any constructive feedback is appreciated**!
